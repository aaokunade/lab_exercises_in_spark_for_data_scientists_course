spark_lab_exercises.
These files contain the lab exercises for my spark training organized by EPCC.
I have done the exercises and add some codes and comments of mine to significantly improve it.
The exercises include the basics of spark concept covering creating, transforming and performing actions on RDD structure.
Then, progressing to sql implementation, numpy and machine learning libraries all within pyspark environment.
The exercises appropriately illustrate the principles of divide, conquer and combine that are required to successfully 
tackle the big data processing bottlenecks.
